# Buidling Images 





_______

## A Simple Dockerfile

## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/2397/a-simple-dockerfile#example)

```
FROM node:5
```

The `FROM` directive specifies an image to start from. Any valid [image reference](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/2279/referencing-images) may be used.

```
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```

The `WORKDIR` directive sets the current working directory inside the container, equivalent to running `cd` inside the container. (Note: `RUN cd` will *not* change the current working directory.)

```
RUN npm install cowsay knock-knock-jokes
```

`RUN` executes the given command inside the container.

```
COPY cowsay-knockknock.js ./
```

`COPY` copies the file or directory specified in the first argument from the build context (the `*path*` passed to `docker build *path*`) to the location in the container specified by the second argument.

```
CMD node cowsay-knockknock.js
```

`CMD` specifies a command to execute when the image is [run](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/2229/running-a-container) and no command is given. It can be overridden by [passing a command to `docker run`](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/2230/running-a-different-command-in-the-container).

There are many other instructions and options; see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for a complete list.

## Buidling Using a Proxy

## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/19296/building-using-a-proxy#example)

Often when building a Docker image, the Dockerfile contains  instructions that runs programs to fetch resources from the Internet (`wget` for example to pull a program binary build on GitHub for example).

It is possible to instruct Docker to pass set set environment  variables so that such programs perform those fetches through a proxy:

```
$ docker build --build-arg http_proxy=http://myproxy.example.com:3128 \
               --build-arg https_proxy=http://myproxy.example.com:3128 \
               --build-arg no_proxy=internal.example.com \
               -t test .
```

`build-arg` are environment variables which are available at build time only.

## Difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD                            



## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/2700/difference-between-entrypoint-and-cmd#example)

There are two `Dockerfile` directives to specify what command to run by default in built images. If you only specify `CMD` then docker will run that command using the default `ENTRYPOINT`, which is `/bin/sh -c`. You can override either or both the entrypoint and/or the command when  you start up the built image. If you specify both, then the `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the executable of your container process, and `CMD` will be supplied as the parameters of that executable.

For example if your `Dockerfile` contains

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
CMD ["/bin/date"]
```

Then you are using the default `ENTRYPOINT` directive of `/bin/sh -c`, and running `/bin/date` with that default entrypoint. The command of your container process will be `/bin/sh -c /bin/date`. Once you run this image then it will by default print out the current date

```
$ docker build -t test .
$ docker run test
Tue Jul 19 10:37:43 UTC 2016
```

You can override `CMD` on the command line, in which case it will run the command you have specified.

```
$ docker run test /bin/hostname
bf0274ec8820
```

If you specify an `ENTRYPOINT` directive, Docker will use that executable, and the `CMD` directive specifies the default parameter(s) of the command. So if your `Dockerfile` contains:

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo"]
CMD ["Hello"]
```

Then running it will produce

```
$ docker build -t test .
$ docker run test
Hello
```

You can provide different parameters if you want to, but they will all run `/bin/echo`

```
$ docker run test Hi
Hi
```

If you want to override the entrypoint listed in your Dockerfile (i.e. if you wish to run a different command than `echo` in this container), then you need to specify the `--entrypoint` parameter on the command line:

```
$ docker run --entrypoint=/bin/hostname test
b2c70e74df18
```

Generally you use the `ENTRYPOINT` directive to point to your main application you want to run, and `CMD` to the default parameters.

## ENTRYPOINT and CMD seen as verb and parameter

â€‹                           

## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/4342/entrypoint-and-cmd-seen-as-verb-and-parameter#example)

Suppose you have a Dockerfile ending with

```
ENTRYPOINT [ "nethogs"] CMD ["wlan0"]
```

if you build this image with a

```
docker built -t inspector .
```

launch the image built with such a Dockerfile with a command such as

```
docker run -it --net=host --rm inspector
```

,nethogs will monitor the interface named wlan0

Now if you want to monitor the interface eth0 (or wlan1, or ra1...), you will do something like

```
docker run -it --net=host --rm inspector eth0
```

or

```
docker run -it --net=host --rm inspector wlan1
```

#                 Exposing a Port  in the Dockerfile                            



## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/4294/exposing-a-port--in-the-dockerfile#example)

```
EXPOSE <port> [<port>...]
```

[From Docker's documentation:](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/expose)

> The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. `EXPOSE` does not make the ports of the container accessible to the host. To do that, you must use either the `-p` flag to publish a range of ports or the `-P` flag to publish all of the exposed ports. You can expose one port number and publish it externally under another number.

## Example:[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/4294/exposing-a-port--in-the-dockerfile#undefined)

Inside your Dockerfile:

```
EXPOSE 8765
```

To access this port from the host machine, include this argument in your `docker run` command:

```
-p 8765:8765
```

#                 Pushing and Pulling an Image to Docker Hub or another Registry                            



## Example[#](https://riptutorial.com/docker/example/12504/pushing-and-pulling-an-image-to-docker-hub-or-another-registry#example)

Locally created images can be pushed to [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com) or any other docker repo host, known as a registry. Use `docker login` to sign in to an existing docker hub account.

```
docker login

Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub.
If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.

Username: cjsimon
Password:
Login Succeeded
```

A different docker registry can be used by specifying a server name.  This also works for private or self-hosted registries. Further, using an [external credentials store](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#/credentials-store) for safety is possible.

```
docker login quay.io
```

You can then tag and push images to the registry that you are logged in to. Your repository must be specified as `server/username/reponame:tag`. Omitting the server currently defaults to Docker Hub. (The default  registry cannot be changed to another provider, and there are [no plans](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7203) to implement this feature.)

```
docker tag mynginx quay.io/cjsimon/mynginx:latest
```

Different tags can be used to represent different versions, or  branches, of the same image. An image with multiple different tags will  display each tag in the same repo.

Use `docker images` to see a list of installed images  installed on your local machine, including your newly tagged image. Then use push to upload it to the registry and pull to download the image.

```
docker push quay.io/cjsimon/mynginx:latest
```

All tags of an images can be pulled by specifying the `-a` option

```
docker pull quay.io/cjsimon/mynginx:latest
```
